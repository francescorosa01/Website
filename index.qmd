Welcome! This is the prototype of my new website always in progress. In this website you can know more about me, about what I consider my job and what I love to do.

I am a Master's student in biology currently writing my thesis at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/). I am investigating behavioral adaptation of the common shrew associated with environmental and physical shifts.
